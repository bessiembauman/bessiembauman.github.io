                <span class="home-subdesc">I’m a rising senior at Yale University, where I’m studying economics. I care deeply about addressing economic inequality, so I’ve focused on studying tax policy, welfare, and community development. I have experience in direct service, academic research, and public policy. I’m always looking for opportunities to give my time and energy to causes helping low- and moderate-income families.</span>
                <span class="home-subdesc">Recently, I have started as an intern for <a href="https://prosperitynow.org/"> Prosperity Now</a>, where I’m working on the Policy Team to contribute to research on federal policies affecting low- and moderate-income families. In April, I was recognized as a member of the <a href="https://www.truman.gov/whats-new/2020-truman-scholars">2020 Class of Truman Scholars</a>. I have also just finished a stint as a site coordinator for “Virtual VITA,” an alternative tax preparation service developed by me and my dear friend and VITA co-coordinator, Tylar Bloch.
